🤖 Auto Mode - Features and Details
📋 Overview
Auto Mode is an automated system designed for complete Stellaris mod translation workflow. It combines all 5 tabs into 3 main phases, significantly reducing time and complexity while providing automatic validation.

✨ Key Benefits
1. Massive Time Saving
Manual Mode: 8-10 steps, 30-60 minutes (excluding translation time)
Auto Mode: 3 steps, click Auto 3 times + 2 confirmations

2. Error Prevention
✅ Automatic input file validation
✅ Symbol count validation (𓁳 and \n) prevents translation errors
✅ Line count verification before merge
✅ Automatic backup of critical files

3. State Persistence
💾 Auto-saves progress to tool_state.json
🔄 Close and reopen program, continue instantly
📍 Remembers current phase and all file paths
⏸️ Pause and resume anytime

4. User Friendly
🎯 Clear UI with status display for every step
📊 Real-time progress bars
💬 Detailed confirmation dialogs explaining next steps
🔔 Notifications when user input needed

5. Flexible
⏯️ Pause at any point, resume later
🔁 Easy reset, start fresh anytime
📂 All intermediate files saved for inspection


🔄 3-Phase Workflow
Phase 1: Extract & Dict
What it does:
Extracts new/updated text from new game version
Compares with old mod version
Creates clean_for_translation.txt (only lines that need translation)
Runs Auto-Extract Dict (finds game codes to preserve, e.g., [planet_type], $LEADER$)

Output:
clean_for_translation.txt → File to translate
Dict.txt → Auto-updated, sorted by length

Waits for user:
✅ Review Dict.txt (remove errors, add needed words)
✅ Click Confirm when ready

Time: 2-5 minutes (depends on file size)
Phase 2: Prepare for Translation
What it does:
Clean & Sort Dict (remove duplicates, sort by length)
Replace Dict words with Unicode symbol (𓁳)
Remove duplicate lines (reduces lines to translate)
Creates _unique.txt and _unique_Backup.txt

Output:
converted_text_XXXXXX_unique.txt → Send to AI for translation
converted_text_XXXXXX_unique_Backup.txt → For validation

Waits for user:
🤖 Send _unique.txt to AI for translation (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
📥 Import translated file via Tab 4 (or in Confirmation Dialog)
✅ Click Confirm when translation complete and imported

Time: 1-3 minutes (excluding translation time)
Example line reduction:
Original: 5,000 lines
After deduplication: 3,200 lines (36% savings)


Phase 3: Merge & Complete
What it does:
Restore translations to duplicate lines
Replace Unicode symbol (𓁳) back to original game codes
Merge translations back into game file structure
Creates Mod folder Updated_Thai_Translation

Output:
📁 output/Updated_Thai_Translation/ → Ready-to-use mod
✅ Can be used in game immediately

Time: 3-8 minutes (depends on number of files)
🛡️ Symbol Validation System
Why is it needed?
Stellaris uses special symbols for display:

𓁳 = Variables that must be preserved
\n = Line breaks

If AI translation loses, adds, or changes the count → Game will display incorrectly
How does it work?

Auto-Check when importing translated file
Counts 𓁳 and \n in each line
Compares with original file
If mismatch:

Creates Error_line.txt (lines with errors)
Creates Original_Compare_Line.txt (original lines for reference)
Creates Error_line_mapping.txt (line positions)
Shows Error Dialog with instructions


User fixes Error_line.txt to match original
Click Confirm → System auto-replaces
Re-validates until 100% correct
Example:

✅ Correct:
Original: "Planet 𓁳 has 𓁳 resources\nPopulation: 𓁳"
Translate: "ดาวเคราะห์ 𓁳 มีทรัพยากร 𓁳\nประชากร: 𓁳"
→ 𓁳 = 3, \n = 1 (match!)

❌ Wrong:
Original: "Planet 𓁳 has 𓁳 resources\nPopulation: 𓁳"
Translate: "ดาวเคราะห์มีทรัพยากร\nประชากร: 𓁳"
→ 𓁳 = 1, \n = 1 (mismatch! should be 3)

🎯 Use Cases
1. Game Updates to New Version
Stellaris releases new DLC
2,000-10,000 new lines of text
Use Auto Mode → Complete in 1-2 hours (including translation)

2. Create Brand New Translation Mod
Total 50,000+ lines
Use Auto Mode → Processing complete in 20-30 minutes
Translation with AI → 2-4 hours (depends on AI)

3. Fix Old Mod with Issues
Old mod incompatible with new game version
Use Phase 1 → Find changed text
Use Phase 2-3 → Merge back


💡 Usage Tips
1. Prepare Files Properly
Recommended structure:
Project/
├── OldV/          (Old game version - English)
├── ThOldV/        (Old mod version - Thai)
├── NewV/          (New game version - English)
├── Dict.txt       (Create empty or use existing)
└── output/        (Auto-created)

2. Review Dict.txt Carefully
Remove:
-" (quote marks)
-Common English words (the, and, is)
-Non-game-code words

Keep:
-[planet_class_xxx]
-$VARIABLE$
-§Y, §!, §R (color codes)
-£energy£, £minerals£ (icon codes)

3. Translate with AI Correctly
Recommended prompt:
Translate this file from English to Thai:
- Keep ALL 𓁳 symbols, don't delete or add
- Keep ALL \n symbols, don't delete or add
- Only translate English text
- Line count must remain the same

4. Use Tab 5 for Post-Merge Checking
-Find remaining English text
-Find Thai with encoding issues
-Find missing or misplaced symbols
